In Mathematics (specficially recreational mathematics) there is a idea such as repdigits (or monodigits)
which are exactly what this check is for. They are natural numbers consisting of only repeated digits.
This is a great check as they quite literally have a function for creating them. This function is

n.(10^(log10(n)+1)+1)

so how do we check if divisible? fuck youre right,, youd have to make this inverse

best way to inverse would be through a inverse function,, which i have done before,,
