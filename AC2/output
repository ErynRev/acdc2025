AC2a = 55916882972

AC2bSILLY.1 = 76171500653  - too high
 //

split in half ac2nums

1-24 =  67846858553 

1-12 =  55931882298

1-6 =   8241992205

so 7-12 should be (55931882298 - 8241992205 =) 47689890093

7-12 = 47689890093 -- correct
then why break? is this correct?

split more

7-9 =   29699110108

10-12 = 17990779985  which both equal 47689890093

so if its too large is it breaking with the 10 digits?
maybe?

AC2bSILLY.2 = 55916882972 (surely not)

ACbSILLY.3 = 76171500653 (again this is what was before,, so whats wrong with this?)

may have to check thro each one GRAH,, GONNA LEAVE FOR NOW
