AC2a = 55916882972

AC2bSILLY.1 = 76171500653  - too high
 //

split in half ac2nums

1-24 =  67846858553 

1-12 =  55931882298

1-6 =   8241992205

so 7-12 should be (55931882298 - 8241992205 =) 47689890093

7-12 = 47689890093 -- correct
then why break? is this correct?

split more

7-9 =   29699110108

10-12 = 17990779985  which both equal 47689890093

so if its too large is it breaking with the 10 digits?
maybe?

AC2bSILLY.2 = 55916882972 (surely not)

ACbSILLY.3 = 76171500653 (again this is what was before,, so whats wrong with this?)

may have to check thro each one GRAH,, GONNA LEAVE FOR NOW





hi again

1-18 = 57354215219  
19-37= 66571874652  


I MIGHT JUST BE A FUCKEN DUMBASS
numbers were a bit fucked
output = 76171500653

fuck never mind im just DUMBASS

1-18 = 57354215219
19-37= 18817285434

same !  = 76171500653

FUCK this number is too high,, so where is this edge case??
the edge case is when we get the exact palindrome checking numbers we are using
this wouldnt make sense as 1010101 is not a rep digit
how do we stop? we check how many digits should be left when dividing - do  wn check for 111n


evidence::
"
num = 1010101    -- digits are 7 
1111111
1010101
pal = 1010101    and count = 4000999
Repeated digit is = 1   , Palindrome diviser is 1010101  
986483   and 1010101     ,, count is 4000999
"
that means when we get the exact match to a palindrome (which doesnt work for repeated digits) then we get an incorrect answer
SOOOOO
i gotta do its own thing for 1 n times and the other palindrome checkers,, easy! (i hope)

make it so fn doesnt create 111111 ,, can make this ourselves

989898 
BRO YOU DONT NEED 1111 BC YOUCAN ALSO JUST DIVIDE BY 10101 AND GET IT right
altho how is this with 11


DONE !! YIPPEEE

output from this for the whole search is =
